# Color Coherence Vectors Repository

This repository contains a collection of codebases for creating Color Coherence Vectors (CCV) based on the research paper titled "Comparing Images Using Color Coherence Vectors" by Greg Pass, Ramin Zabih, and Justin Miller from Cornell University.

## Paper
The research paper can be found [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdz/Papers/PZM-MM96.pdf). It provides an in-depth explanation of the concept of Color Coherence Vectors and their advantages over color histograms in image comparison.

## Abstract
Color histograms have been widely used for image comparison due to their computational efficiency and insensitivity to small changes in camera viewpoint. However, color histograms lack spatial information, leading to similar histograms for images with different appearances. This repository addresses this limitation by introducing Color Coherence Vectors (CCV), which incorporate spatial information in the image comparison process. CCV classify each pixel as either coherent or incoherent based on its membership in a large similarly-colored region. By separating coherent and incoherent pixels, CCV provide finer distinctions than color histograms. The repository includes code to compute CCV and demonstrates their superiority over color histograms in image retrieval tasks.

## Key Features
- Efficient computation of Color Coherence Vectors
